# SimpleProgramInML
This repo is created to log my curriculum design in Principles of Computer Composition, requesting us to fullfill the requirements with machine language.
Here I am going to describe the tasks first, and I will upload the assignment book descrbing the tasks more detailedly after removing some private infomation.
## Assignments
1. Input an octal number ranging from xx using xx input ports. And the result it mods 3 will determine which subprogram will run. For example, if the input is 1, the result it mods 3 is 1, thus the second subprogram will be picked up to run.
